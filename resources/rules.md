## ❔ How do I get help?
Please read this before posting: https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask

<br>

You may post your question in the relevant 🚧 **DEV ZONE** channel. If your question is urgent, you may ping one of the *help-* roles once per hour, and preferably not more than a few times a day. **DO NOT** look for help in the 💖 **COMMUNITY** channels.
 
 
## 💰 Jobs
Post job listings and "for hire" advertisements in the 💰 **PAID WORK** category.

### Rules
- Keep proof, for those on both sides of a transaction. 
- Scamming is a permanent and instant ban if proven. We will not take action if no proof is received.
- Be smart. If it's too good to be true, it's too good to be true.
- Absolutely no trolling, memeing, or offtopic is allowed in any jobs channel.
- No unpaid or revenue share positions allowed in the Jobs channels.
- Don't post illegal jobs, or those that break a website's Terms of Service.
- Don't bump your post more than once a week.
- Always remove your old post when you bump.

### Template
- Begin your post with [...] where ... is a list of comma separated tags that summarize your job posting. FRONTEND is a good broad tag, followed by a JS framework like ANGULAR. ex: [FRONTEND, ANGULAR] - the point is to make it brief, to help job seekers find jobs that match their skills and job posters find people who match their position.
- Always note location, REMOTE or whatever CITY/COUNTRY you are listing for.
- Always note term, TEMP, CONTRACT, INTERNSHIP, FULLTIME, etc.
- If you are looking for SENIORs or you are one, add the tag.
- Posts that do not follow the rules and guidelines will be removed.
